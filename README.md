 Our features will consist of regular season stats. These can be found on many different places on the internet. Many websites have data from before 2000 all the way until now.   Our targets will be the spot in the bracket that they made it to (final four, elite eight, etc.). This makes this a good classification problem because it allows for some flexibility since it does not mean that we are going to have a set number of teams that make it to each spot. In order to select each spot if there are ties, confidence intervals can be used in order to determine which team is likely the stronger team.
